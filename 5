1. Explain the main sources of Data flood.

ANSWER: there were so many sources available for data source.data flood means a huge pile of data's stored.each network or organization will have a
data flood for its own. for example social network like facebook stores more tahn 240 million photos.which ahas a constant growth of 7 petabytes
each day.

2. What is the difference between Data and Big data.

ANSWER: 
Big data:
        Big Data is a concept in Software Engineering which we use when we have a large sets of machine generated data, which in most of 
        the cases is unstructured and not easy to use with traditional RDBMS concepts. 
Data:
                    Data Analytics on the other hand is more of analyzing data which could be structured or unstructured. Even 
                    though they both sound similar, there have different objectives. Out of huge data sets, when you want to narrow d
                    own a piece of customized data, we do number of steps in analyzing like investigating data, cleaning, transforming and
                    getting the result.
 
3 )Main reason behind the Hadoop become the solution for Data explosion:
              
·         Hadoop is an open source ,java-based programming framework that supports the processing of large data sets in a distributed
          computing environment.

·         Hadoop provides: A reliable,Scalable platform for storage and analysis.

·         It is based on Google File Syatem or GFS.

·         Hadoop runs a number of applications on distributed systems with thousands of nodes involving petabytes of data.

·         It has a distributed file system,called the Hadoop Distributed File System or HDFS,which enable fast data transfer among the 
          nodes.
